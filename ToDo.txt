Make start value range configurable
Need to deal with tags

Benchmark client - simulate queries

Put in optimistic locking for creation of time series blocks to avoid concurrency issues
Do I need tests to check what happens when generating multiple time series

Deal with retrospective inserts
End times as part of the metadata - might simplify things?

Grep for the word 'test' in code - can some methods etc be moved to test classes - e.g. static factory method

BatchInsert
-----------

Allow 1D,1H values for batch insert

Done
====

Instead of lists, k ordered maps?
Once block has more than a specified number of entries, rename it to SeriesName-StartDate and remove block with key SeriesName
Keeping track of blocks - use an index record
When copying, make map kv ordered
GetPoints for time range outside a single block
When copying record can a subsequent setMapPolicy call be avoided?
Benchmark client - multi thread
Factor out printstream so it can be assigned to by unit tests
Hotkey warning message
Underflow message
Benchmarking Tool
	- control rate
	- no of series
	- frequency
Wrap client so it can be run from cmd line
Tests for command line run - check correctMainOutput function
Better handling for ParseException (Integer.parseInt)
mvn magic allowing separate build of benchmark client
Gaussian randomness generation built in with drift and volatility
Benchmark client - batch puts
Benchmark client - bulk insert
Check good/bad run modes are tested this means values for the -m parameter
Count records better when doing batch insert - keep inserting until the time range is exceeded, which allows for some randomness in time values, rather than inserting a set number of records
