Make start value range configurable
Need to deal with tags

Benchmark client - bulk insert
Benchmark client - simulate queries

Put in optimistic locking for creation of time series blocks to avoid concurrency issues

Done
====

Instead of lists, k ordered maps?
Once block has more than a specified number of entries, rename it to SeriesName-StartDate and remove block with key SeriesName
Keeping track of blocks - use an index record
When copying, make map kv ordered
GetPoints for time range outside a single block
When copying record can a subsequent setMapPolicy call be avoided?
Benchmark client - multi thread
Factor out printstream so it can be assigned to by unit tests
Hotkey warning message
Underflow message
Benchmarking Tool
	- control rate
	- no of series
	- frequency
Wrap client so it can be run from cmd line
Tests for command line run - check correctMainOutput function
Better handling for ParseException (Integer.parseInt)
mvn magic allowing separate build of benchmark client
Gaussian randomness generation built in with drift and volatility
Benchmark client - batch puts
